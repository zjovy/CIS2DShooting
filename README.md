# CIS 2D Shooting
2D Shooting Game

Introduction:
A mini-game type of 2D shooting game with simple mechanics and fast paced gameplay. 

Mechanics:
Players will be able to level up through defeating monsters and advancing levels. Leveling up increases the stats of the player.
There will be a score system. The score of the player will be based on what kind of monster the player defeats and how long the player survives.
After each level, the player's score turns into gold, and they can use it to buy upgrades and power-ups.
If possible, we want to have randomly generated levels (or pre-designed maps randomly selected as the next level).
The game's difficulty increases as the player advances the levels.

Controls:
The player can move around using WASD keys.
The player can attack and defend using the same key, and the function alternates. Different upgrades and power-ups will affect how attacking and defending works. The player needs to work with this control and the play style revolves around this.
